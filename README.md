# ColorsRGB
This simple app allows you to play with color sliders and save any colors you want. The background will match whatever color is currently active, and the red, green, and blue sliders will increase or decrease the amount of that color, from 0 (none) to 255 (maximum). The hexadecimal representation of the active color will also be shown and updated constantly. Once you save a color, it will appear in a list below the ‘Save Color’ button, and the active color will reset to black. You can select any color from the list at any time to make that color the active color, changing the sliders, background, and hexadecimal representation accordingly.
